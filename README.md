## Summary

This is one of the many variations of Rock-Paper-Scissors called Bear-Ninja-Cowboy.  In case you are not sure: Bear beats Ninja, Ninja beats Cowboy, and Cowboy beats Bear.
Since the logic came fairly quickly for this, I decided to spend some more time on the presentation.  I found that a little CSS goes a long way, and that it can drastically change the experience of even the simplest application.
